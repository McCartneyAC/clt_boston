📉 🏘️ A very basic shiny app for understanding the CLT


I listened to the Central Limit Theorem / Normal Distsribution episode of Linear Digressions while running some errands tonight and I got to thinking about making a simulation of the Central Limit Theorem based on their episode. Ben and Katie use the Boston Housing Prices dataset as a point of departure, so I pulled a sample of the dataset from Kaggle. This allows us to simulate the repeated-draws of the CLT on the housing price variable to get an understanding of how it better approximates a normal distribution as the number of draws increases.

The actual mean of the dataset is 22.77 for the 333 observations randomly drawn by Kaggle. The actual distribution is shown here, followed by a distribution generated by you (see the controls on the sidebar). The Central Limit Theorem says that, no matter the underlying distribution of the data, the distribution of means generated by pulling repeated random samples will be Gaussian / Normally distributed. This marvellous fact allows for significance testing in statistics and is the link between probability that underlies much of the work being done when we do statistics.
